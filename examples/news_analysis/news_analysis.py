"""News Article Bias Detection.

This script demonstrates how to use fenic's semantic classification capabilities to detect editorial bias and analyze news articles. We'll walk through:

- Language Analysis using `semantic.extract()` to find biased, emotional, or sensationalist language.
- Political Bias Classifcation using `semantic.classify()` grounded in the extracted data.
- News Topic Classification using `semantic.classify()`
- Merging the information together using `semantic.reduce()` to create a 'Media Profile' summary for each analyzed News Source

This is a practical example of how semantic classification can provide insights into media content.

Usage:
    python news_analysis.py

Wednesday's rate hike to 5.5% will make mortgages, credit cards, and student loans more expensive for millions of Americans already struggling with housing costs.
