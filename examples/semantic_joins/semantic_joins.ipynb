    "# Semantic Joins with LLM Reasoning\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use semantic joins powered by large language models (LLMs) in Fenic to perform context-aware data matching and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic joins enable you to flexibly join tables based on natural language instructions, leveraging LLM reasoning rather than strict key or embedding similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll see two practical scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matching users to relevant articles**: Join user profiles with articles by reasoning about their interests and the article descriptions.\n",
    "- **Product recommendations**: Suggest products to customers based on their purchase history using semantic relationships between purchased and recommended items.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows for more intuitive and powerful data enrichment, recommendation, and matching workflows, all driven by natural language join instructions."
